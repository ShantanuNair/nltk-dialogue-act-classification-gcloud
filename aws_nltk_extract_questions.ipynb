was, like, 12 13 and I think I always, um I love telling people what to do.\", 'So baby director does that to a certain degree as well.', \"So maybe that's why that and so, um so So tell us just quickly about your career path.\", 'You kind of bounced around in different companies.', 'You started it.', 'Will you start a company dropped at college?', 'He started this company.', \"Let's start there.\", 'What?', 'What was the company?', 'Give us the 12th pitch and tell us you raise a little bit of money from friends of family and tell us what happened.', 'The company is called seven a day.', 'Um and just imagine a marketplace that has a curious curated list seven products a day that the name kind of gives it away available, but the amount of them in stock is very limited.', 'And rather than telling you how much how many over the items are in stock, there is a bar that indicates that other people are buying these products and the price drops constantly throughout the day.', \"So at some point you see the savings and you see that there is not many items left in stock, and we were betting on the fact that you're super ansi to purchase that product except nobody really did that there was in 99.\", 'So to our defense, not many people bought anything but books online.', 'And we had lots of electron ICS and other stuff.', 'Even less people purchase something in Europe or in Germany.', 'So we had the company for around a year and we bootstrapped it.', 'Yeah, and and then what happened?', 'You just you shut it down or you did you guys just move on to other things or what what happened with your your team members and what we spend all our parents money at that time.', 'So we have we have to shut it down.', 'And when we decided to get jobs and maybe earn a little bit ourselves, did how did they feel about that?', 'Was that Ah, were they expecting?', \"I mean, you're never you're never hoping to lose your money when you're vesting, but was was the expectation

5000 Deutschmarks because I learned my parents into believing that it wouldn't be that expensive.\", 'And I spent nights and days and, you know, you have to buy these excess codes and pre a well, So that was the first thing, then I think they lost a ton of money because of me in the stock market.', 'Because at that time I convinced him to buy Apple stock, which then went nowhere for for sometimes

there.', 'But how did how did you meet these two guys?', 'Well, I Sam was a friend of mine in London.', 'Um, I moved from I moved from living in Germany, in Munich, in Berlin.', 'I moved to the UK to London.', 'I worked for P A consulting.', \"It's a consulting firm.\", \"They say I don't even remember in details anymore what I did there because it's it's really boring, mind numbing stuff.\",

the company of Sean.', 'Our third co founder was called Huck Energy.', 'Okay, And And how did what happened with Curated by How did how did that kind of evolve into Postmates secure?', 'Aided by was, I think was just a really the other thing that I knew um, for almost as long as I can remember is that at some point I would love to have a company in the United States in the Valley.', 'So even when I was 14 15 years old, um, you know, I had that being a director dream, and I think relatively shortly after that, the other thing that would interest me was to run a startup in, in In in Silicon Valley.', 'And I read so much about it.', \"And of course, you read the newspapers and you read the things and you're inspired by the companies.\", 'In my case, it took a bit longer to get here, but it had always been my dream.', 'So, um, was the company curated by we just met Two Most Corte who was one of the guys who runs Angel Pattern.', \"He's German.\", \"And even though the idea was incredibly stupid, he said, You know, I'm sure you guys figure out eventually what you want to do.\", \"But if you guys come to the States, I'm going to introduce you to the network that I have.\", \"And that was an opportunity that that I just couldn't resist, given the fact that for the last 15 plus years.\", 'I you know, one of your dreams.', 'Yeah.', 'And so what happened?', 'You got here, You You go into the way.', 'We pretty much figured out that the idea is completely stupid.', \"And, um, that it's not something that we want to spend the rest of our the rest of our lives on.\", 'Um, we also had a really hard time raising money.', 'You talked about Navalny earlier.', 'I give you a quick story about novel how I met him.', 'We pitched him as an angel investor is actually a great story That probably shows a little bit of resilience and how important it is to, like, keep in touch with people So way pitched him.', \"And he said, You know, here seem like a cool guy, but that's never gonna work.\", 'And, uh, custom curated by pitching curated, Yeah, and and really to just think about curated by think about it.', \"It's a curation tool that allows you to put content predominantly tweeds into bundles that you're an expert, often share that with other people.\", \"So there's all that stuff out there, and we thought it would be great if to give you better tools to curate that information.\", \"And so we pitched him on that, um and and and he didn't want any of that.\", \"But he said, you know, I'm doing kind of a startup myself.\", 'Angel list.', \"He just started doing that and he said, Why don't you guys join me as venture hackers and you're going to get a 1,000,000 in equity each.\", 'And you and Sam, you know, we could really do something cool together.', 'We thought about this for the day, and then we declined.', 'And we said, You know, this is awesome.', 'Like for you to join the Angelis team?', 'Yeah, he basically turned a VC pitch into a recruiting pitch on his son.', \"And he's good at that.\", 'Yeah.', \"Um, and I don't know.\", 'Many of you know, one of all you all should know him.', \"I think he's a little bit more difficult to get hold of these days, then 2000, 10,000 women.\", \"But he's a great guy if you have a chance to talk to him.\", 'So he tries to turn this conversation to recruiting pitch.', 'We decline.', 'But I asked him one question in that recruiting pitch, and that is what happened I asked him what would happen to the money that we has raised.', 'So the money from Thomas and that that impressed him because, um, if you guys read about what nerve all did in the past, he he had his rough.', 'Petrus two was investors in the Valley and, um, thrown out of his company thrown out of this company.', 'So he was impressed that we would that we would be concerned about not burning any bridges with the investors into Postmates.', 'And he said into curated by and he said, You know, we would take care of them but we still declined the offer.', 'But fast forward 66 months later was only six months when we started working on Postmates.', 'He was the first person that we pitched and he had just invested in uber, I think three or four months earlier, and we walked in the office and it was the three of us.', 'So he knew us from Angel Pat and we had, um just a working prototype and literally always showed him is like that we could enter something on this iPhone and the other iPhone, the Postmates Courier iPhone would beat, and you would see these two people moving on the map.', 'And he he wrote a check over $250,000 in that meeting.', 'Um, and he let our seat.', 'Wow.', \"I just thought that's a great story.\", 'That is a great story.', \"Yeah, that's never happened in any of my meetings with him.\", \"Yeah, um, I'm kind of upset about it now.\", 'Um What?', 'What?', 'Where did this idea come from?', \"Where did where did Postmates where did your do curated by Okay doesn't work.\", 'Then where do suppose makes come from?', \"What's the genesis of the idea?\", \"So I have this ledger of ideas just like I'm sure you guys all have that and some of them just keep haunting you.\", 'And Postmates was one of these ideas that just kept haunting me.', 'I had the idea just when I moved to London, I moved from Munich to London.', \"And believe it or not, I had this, you know, you whole coming by and we loaded it and drove all the stuff to my parents players because, you know, you don't really want to take it all in in a new city in another country with you at first, and they forgot to take my snowboard.\", \"So I'm I'm a week.\", \"Our there's basically nothing in my house.\", \"I'm staying at a friend's place and there's to snowboard still there, So I'm trying to figure out how I can get my snow.\", \"But to my parent's place, um, ups FedEx cost a fortune.\", 'In Germany, the item is considered frayed.', 'They want you to wrap it.', 'The whole thing was just horrible.', 'So I started calling local Korea companies and they just gave us, gave me weird quotes.', 'Some would tell me that they could do it in two months because they had a trip plant.', 'My parents live outside Berlin.', \"It's 500 miles or some.\", \"That's something they could do tonight.\", 'Charged 400 euros.', 'So it was just a wild world out there.', 'But what would happen is that two days later, a friend called me and he said, You know what?', \"I'm driving up to blend.\", \"You just want me to drop this off your mom's place.\", 'Now Germany is very different geography wise than the United States.', 'You have 80 84 million people.', 'You have a load off cities with a 1,000,000 plus people in relatively close proximity.', 'People travel a lot on the weekend.', 'Students that study and frank for drive back to Munich or drive to Cologne.', 'People from Hamburg visit Berlin, so you have a lot more traveling throughout the country than you have it in the US, and right sharing had already been a huge thing.', 'People leverage right sharing very differently because of that infrastructure of people traveling.', 'So the original idea of Postmates that the very, very 1st 1 was just what if you could, like, create a friendly aversion and, like the Postal Service, like where your friends carry the stuff for you because they already travel to a destination anyway?', 'Was the seal time that the U experiences?', \"I mean, that's kind of Ah, it's kind of a rare use case, right?\", \"Like where you forget something totally different than like I'm hungry every single day.\", \"And I'm too lazy to go, you know where I don't have the time to go.\", 'I mean, that happens all the time, right?', 'I mean, did did you like, did you think wow, this this could be huge thing?', \"Or was it like, Hey, I'm just going to solve this problem.\", 'And I mean, did you This market could be that early on Or was it was it?', \"You know, Did you think you're gonna use it every single day?\", 'Or do you think I might use it once a month or what?', 'What did you think?', 'People?', 'How did you think people would use it?', \"Where I think he is An interesting thing, that that probably happens very often when you when you have an idea and that that is probably that you that you're so euphoric about the idea and that you are so excited about what you have discovered that at least for myself, I'm often when the when the idea is just it's just very fragile and it's still very young.\", 'You get you get so excited about everything surrounding it that I think you can over project the frequency of use off these things.', \"And I remember that definitely back at the time, we were like, Oh my God, if it's that easy, people will clearly do it more off just because it's that easy.\", \"And I think that's actually one of one of the dangers off when you when you start with an idea of getting married to a specific thing too early.\", \"I mean, for Postmates, it's It took then four years, and it took a couple of it orations for us to figure out that that's actually not the use case that would ever grow that company fast.\", \"At some point, we figured out it's prepared food, and by 45 years I mean, like, obviously didn't work on the idea for a long time.\", 'But even when we got back to the idea, we started to look at it from an angle of, like, delivering things within your city.', \"But we still hadn't figured out the idea like, What is the trigger?\", \"What's the most frequent inventory in a city that you can use every day?\", 'And it turned out that that will be prepared food.', 'But customers did guide us way we.', \"It was none of us just waking up one day and saying like it's a no brainer.\", 'We do prepared food, and sometimes that is probably because how you think about the product, you think about it and like its ultimate form.', \"And I think that's totally what Postmates will be that then, if you need to do something like the stuff I had to do was most nobody's available.\", \"But in order to get there, you're probably I think that the way to get there is what we missed at the beginning.\", 'So when you launched, how did you launch originally?', 'Did you have your own drivers and riders?', 'Did you Did you use other existing infrastructure?', 'What did you do at the very beginning?', 'We signed up every any every existing messenger company in San Francisco.', 'We signed up on the platform, their herds, their own 25 or 30 of them, and I would run around and we would pitch them one by one.', 'And we would give them iPhones.', \"And we would tell them like, Look, you know, you don't have much to do, So, uh, he here's a great way because we will have a lot off things to do for you.\", 'So be part of this.', \"And did it work didn't work.\", 'Why not?', 'What?', 'They were all excited about it.', 'But, you know, I think the messenger industry in general is like is like an industry that has been, um, they have been really like there have been like pushed almost unlike the like the outskirts off society.', 'They like the renegades, right?', 'I mean, they there was a time, and it meant it was a glorious thing.', 'And when when everybody needed messengers and in cities like New York and San Francisco there were big and thriving.', 'And and then, you know, pdf came along, a lot of other things happened.', 'So being a messenger kind of pushed you more and more into, like, one off jobs, not very regular customer relationships, very comparable products.', 'And so they that that whole community became a little bitter and it became a little guarded.', \"And and I think that's what we felt when we started working with them.\", 'It becomes more of a lifestyle than it.', 'Then it really becomes a business.', 'And And you were talking about your customers kind of guiding you.', \"Um, I read about a story where basically you your customers started writing in the notes in the app and saying, Hey, we want I don't want you to bring me this furniture.\", 'But I I would like you to bring me some food or would like you to bring me this or that.', 'Tell us about that, how that evolution happened and then the shift that you made in the company.', 'That is actually an upsetting story, because we, the first version of post ments that we created, was a beautiful product.', 'It looked like a note pad, and it was designed for local merchants.', \"We had talked to hundreds of merchants in San Francisco, and we had determined that the biggest pain point for them is that somebody comes in the store, wants to buy a product, and they can't deliver it.\", \"So we've designed an app that would do that for them.\", \"Um, it's an app that they could install.\", \"Or they would even give them in some cases and and iPod or whatever to run it on and two taps you enter the pickup pretty fall, that's your store, you enter a drop off, and we signed up every single furniture store in San Francisco three or four years ago, and there were also excited to use the app Um, and then we built the up for them and nothing happened.\", \"As in, there wasn't many stores that actually used it, and they used that.\", 'They used it every once in a while, so we started talking to them.', 'A long story short.', 'What happened in instead is that customers who would download the at the AP they would as a pickup, enter a store or a restaurant and in the description field they would just type a shopping list and they would send off that request to the network.', \"And we had to cancel a lot of these orders simply because we didn't have any payment infrastructure in place.\", \"And this is why it's so such upsetting story because we built this product for the wrong audience.\", 'We build it for the merchant when where we should have started is the customers.', 'Because it turns out that everybody loves the idea that you can point your cell phone like a remote control at a store and you can type down what you want.', 'And you have these items delivered in a couple of minutes.', \"Um, and we didn't see that at all.\", 'What we saw was the need from the merchant side.', 'And so what changed?', 'What shifted and and when you change the product, what happened?', 'Oh, money.', 'I mean, we did a test one weekend, and I think we sold $10,000 worth of merchandise on on the first.', 'On the very first weekend, we send out an email and we said, You know what, guys?', \"This weekend, if you're usedto hashtag, get it now and you enter the items that you want, we're going to get him to you and we At that time I think we had 25 or 30 Postmates.\", 'This is on Twitter something or what?', 'It would mean The hashtag way needed a trigger to guide you to a post made who would have a payment method.', 'And what we did as a payment method is we came from a prepaid gift cards, so we bought tens of thousands of dollars.', 'Worse we, by the way, everybody should try that once in his or her life.', 'Her of his life.', 'Go to a safe way with a credit card and tried to buy $10,000 worth of Visa $100 gift cards.', \"It's the greatest experience in your life.\", \"They called the cops twice, and it's totally insane.\", 'And then try to explain your bank.', \"Who's blocking the transaction?\", \"Why you're buying $10,000 worth of visa gift cards it's it's totally cool, Um, and and it's even better if you have to do that when you when you run out of money and it's like eight or nine oclock and you have to go to one of the dodgy Safeways because you basically show it all the other one hearts on all the other one.\", \"That's a true story.\", 'We sold out almost the entire city of San Francisco someone.', \"There were only $50 gift cards left, and we will distribute them to the fleet because at that time we didn't have another payment method.\", 'But once we started this experiment, we had to obviously keep it going and people wanted it and wanted more and more and more of it.', 'So, um, we wrote some clever systems on for curious to keep a tally we show on, my co founder invented a system that would auto dial.', 'They want 800 numbers on the back off a visa gift card to check the balance so that we could have some sort of like understanding on wherever stand.', 'Um, yeah, there was crazy.', 'Where did you find these original writers?', 'Where did they come from?', 'So at some point, I think we just did, um, to things.', 'We did ads at universities at college boards and we did cracks.', \"This That's OK. That was the very first does.\", 'It was your first dozens of Postmates.', 'Yeah, and And how did you What did you learn from from those very first ones?', 'And how did that change over time turns?', 'Who you recruited, like, Who is your Who is the perfect post mate for you guys?', \"We probably didn't pay enough attention to the rich.\", 'Probably should have.', 'Should have paid way more attention to the to the couple of first ones.', 'I think the learnings on the supply side have been for the people who follow the company.', 'I think we did not pay enough attention to the supply side until about 18 months.', 'Two years in.', 'And there was a time when it was a lot of it has been written that, you know, it was impossible to get a post made to accept the delivery.', 'And I think until we really hit it big attraction.', \"We probably didn't care about the supply side understanding who they are from a monetary compensation.\", 'We or we always cared about them but understanding who they are and what drives them.', 'We probably neglected that side of the business for I would say 18 months.', 'And what about now?', 'Like what?', 'When you think of the Postmates.', 'What?', 'What is so great about your product that keeps them coming back?', 'What?', 'What do you How do you think about them?', 'What?', 'How do you How do you look?', 'A look at them.', \"So we have this metrics internally, and the cool thing about it is after after after somebody did 10 deliveries, we know if that's going to be a power post made or a regular post made.\", \"So one of the things that we're that we're trying to do is to understand the 1st 10 deliveries.\", \"They define the experience for Postmates on the Postmates platform, and we're trying to do a lot of design and understanding and measuring around those 1st 10 deliveries before that.\", 'Um, it is a bunch of boring stuff.', \"Ah, that that it's probably not as exciting and a lot of it has to do with a relatively deep source list.\", 'That means not just relying on one platform, but we have I would say 2030 channels for the supply side acquisition rather than just relying on Praxis stance.', 'So many interesting things about this thing company and about your story in particular.', 'I think one of those is that you were talking about you guys starting this in 2011.', 'And I can I moved here in 2005 and I can remember to those 11 very clearly and every startup that I met at start of grand, wherever else was working on, like a group on cologne or an incubator.', 'You know, it was like there were these, you know, and you see it today.', \"There are all these themes and it just kind of comes in and and now it's like we're in 2015.\", \"It's four years later and like on demand is just the rage, right?\", \"And and here you guys have been working on it for years and years and years, and it's like it's like you're this startup that is an overnight success.\", 'Five years, four years in the making, and I wonder, like, What has that been like for you?', \"Is somebody that's been toiling away, You know, just on this concept and figuring it out.\", 'And as you see all these people coming in, what like how do you What is your perception and what are your thoughts on how hot this whole topic has become and all these people that have kind of jumped into the space?', 'So we knew that this would be huge.', \"I don't know why.\", \"And I don't mean Postmates.\", \"I'm in this space.\", \"Um, I don't know why, but when when we started the company in 2011 I think there were already a lot of signals that would point towards a world that works faster than then than the current work and then the current world.\", \"And we I don't think we had an idea on how much impact on demand space could have on commerce.\", 'But I think what we did that we looked at the status quo, and we looked at how the world works, works and how it used to work.', \"And I think a good indicator on how the future is going to be is that it probably doesn't look anything like the past.\", 'So, you know, rather than believing that the space will be good, we also had really deep believe, believe in ourselves that this is something that we want to do.', \"And I think sometimes that's more important than just riding a wave that you can already see, right?\", 'I mean, some of the best serve you get if you wait out there for like, you know, 34 hours, others leave.', 'The others leave, go back to the beach, drive home.', 'But if you wait long enough sometimes debt wave that wave, that perfect waves, a couple of them, the 10 12 minutes build up and you have an amazing surf.', \"And and and I think that's kind of how we felt now, how we feel now in that space, I'm not saying that we feel that we're the best in that space.\", \"But there is something cool about the fact that if I look back what I talked about four years ago, it's the same crap to talk about today, right?\", \"So but but it it kind of happened, that's that, to me, is interesting.\", 'Um, up until a year and 1/2 ago, you all had not raised more than 10 more than single digit millions of dollars, and I wonder if you could talk to us a little bit about what your experience was with investors.', 'You have some of the best angel investors in the valley.', \"Um, but when you got to your first year, Siri's a round talk to us.\", 'Like, was it?', 'Did people get it?', 'This is just a couple of years ago, but did people understand where this was going?', 'It that they figured it out?', 'Um, you know what?', 'What was that experience like?', 'Yes.', 'So I think I have a good read on that now because actually thought about this a lot.', 'I thought about just for some background.', \"We had a great time raising a seat round, and you're right.\", \"We had some really smart investors in the Cedrone, and then we had a really tough time raising our Syria's A and ultimately Founders Fund.\", \"Let the Syria's A and Bryan Singer minute founders funded and everything was great.\", 'But I think what happened is the following.', 'Um, we knew that the space would work out to be something really exciting.', \"And for angel investors, that's probably all that they care about.\", \"They care about a group of really smart people, really passionate about a topic And is that person then telling a convincing story why the

            "And we I don't think we had an idea on how much impact on demand space could have on commerce.\n",
            "QQ: But I think what we did that we looked at the status quo, and we looked at how the world works, works and how it used to work.\n",
            "And I think a good indicator on how the future is going to be is that it probably doesn't look anything like the past.\n",

            "So but but it it kind of happened, that's that, to me, is interesting.\n",
            "Um, up until a year and 1/2 ago, you all had not raised more than 10 more than single digit millions of dollars, and I wonder if you could talk to us a little bit about what your experience was with investors.\n",
            "You have some of the best angel investors in the valley.\n",

            "QQ: What was that experience like?\n",
            "Yes.\n",
            "So I think I have a good read on that now because actually thought about this a lot.\n",
            "I thought about just for some background.\n",
            "We had a great time raising a seat round, and you're right.\n",
            "We had some really smart investors in the Cedrone, and then we had a really tough time raising our Syria's A and ultimately Founders Fund.\n",
            "Let the Syria's A and Bryan Singer minute founders funded and everything was great.\n",
            "But I think what happened is the following.\n",
            "Um, we knew that the space would work out to be something really exciting.\n",
            "And for angel investors, that's probably all that they care about.\n",
            "They care about a group of really smart people, really passionate about a topic And is that person then telling a convincing story why the company that they're start to build can be one of the forerunners?\n",
            "If that space is gonna happen now, that's probably all you need to raise your seat round and to raise.\n",
            "Maybe, you know, whatever you call it an angel round.\n",
            "But when we came to the first institutional investors, a lot of what we were talking about it hadn't happened yet.\n",
            "So in in end of 2012 when we raised our serious A, we didn't have any Starbucks.\n",
            "Walgreens, 7 11 Chipotle, a strategic partnership.\n",
            "We didn't have millions off deliveries.\n",
            "We didn't have tens of thousands of couriers or hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales on the platform.\n",
            "It was still us just talking about it.\n",
            "And that was a lot for them to believe that a the space would develop and B that we would be one of the companies that, in whatever sends that term makes any sense, would lead that space.\n",
            "So you have the same guys running around.\n",
            "The product looks great, but the the volume is very low.\n",
            "There's no partnerships now.\n",
            "We know it's just because the space and the world just probably needed another year or two until you know more and more companies enter that market to to really push the market.\n",
            "But I think that's what happened.\n",
            "So sometimes you can almost be a little bit too early and and and I believe that's what happened to us in the Syria say there were no competitive, uh, almost no competitors, very few data points to look at.\n",
            "So you know, you you got to believe in these guys hard if you if you race, if you lead the Syria's A because it's institutional money, it means a lot.\n",
            "It's just different things that that someone like an institution investor looks at then your angel or seed investor and what ultimately, push it over for you.\n",
            "You you you met with all the top investors in the Valley.\n",
            "Basically, most of them said no and they never say no.\n",
            "They say, You know, let's keep talking.\n",
            "Nobody says no, That's the old rule, right?\n",
